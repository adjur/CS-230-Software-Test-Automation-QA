# CS 320 Portfolio Submission

This repository contains selected artifacts from CS 320 that demonstrate my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. Included are the Contact Service files from Project One and the summary and reflections report from Project Two. Together, these pieces show my ability to write unit tests, analyze testing strategies, and build reliable, well-structured code.

## Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?  
I ensure functionality by using unit tests to verify both typical behavior and edge cases. Automated testing helps me catch problems early and prevents new updates from breaking existing features. To keep code secure, I validate input, avoid unsafe assumptions, and design methods to handle unexpected data safely. Even in small assignments, thinking about potential misuse helps build more reliable software.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  
I interpret user needs by breaking requirements down into clear, testable rules. For example, if a user specifies limits on contact fields, I turn those rules into input validation and corresponding tests. Understanding what the user is actually trying to accomplish allows me to design the program so it truly meets their needs rather than just checking off requirements.

### How do I approach designing software?  
My approach is to divide the program into small, focused components that each handle one responsibility. In these projects, separating the Contact class from the ContactService class and writing tests for each kept the code organized and easier to maintain. I also design with testing in mind from the start; if something is difficult to test, that usually means the design can be improved. My goal is always to write code that is clear, maintainable, and well-supported by automated tests.
