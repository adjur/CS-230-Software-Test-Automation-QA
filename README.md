# CS-230-Software-Test-Automation-QA

CS 320 Portfolio Submission
This repository contains selected artifacts from CS 320 that demonstrate my work with software testing, automation, and quality assurance. These include the Contact Service files from Project One and my summary and reflections report from Project Two.

Reflection
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure functionality by writing and running unit tests that cover expected behavior as well as edge cases. Automated testing helps me catch errors early and confirm that updates don’t break previous features. For security, I make sure to validate all inputs, avoid unsafe assumptions in the code, and design methods so they fail safely rather than unpredictably. Even in small projects, thinking about how incorrect data could be misused helps keep the software more secure.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by breaking down requirements into clear, testable pieces. If a requirement states that an ID must be a certain length or that certain fields can’t be null, I translate those needs into validation rules and test cases. Understanding the “why” behind a requirement makes it easier to design behavior that actually supports the user’s goals rather than just meeting the minimum technical specification.
How do I approach designing software?
My approach is to divide the program into small, focused components and give each part a clear responsibility. In these projects, separating Contact from ContactService and writing tests for each made the design cleaner and easier to maintain. I also think about testing from the start—if something is hard to test, it’s usually a sign that the design can be simplified. Overall, I aim for readable, maintainable code supported by strong automated tests.
